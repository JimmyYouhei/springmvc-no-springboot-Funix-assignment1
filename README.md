- a page to print fibonacci numbers that is < 10946
- A jsp Couse register page and another page to show the result

## Version
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE)
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included. As a result please download yourself

Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in the project

## How to install
please import as a maven project

## Project detail

-	This is the project that used Spring MVC and JSP to complete the assignment 1 (this is my original intention)
-	This project did not use Spring Boot for me to feel the pain to manually config the project myself 
-	The config files are inside the “config” package
-	The project is configured using only Java (no XML) as this is the modern way . Yeah , I knew old projects still used XML config
-	Like the above project, this project follows MVC architecture.  I hope my naming of packages and classes are self-explanatory  

##	Possible Issue 
-	Minimal testing, as a result very few exceptions are found and handled as Funix requirement is not strict

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
